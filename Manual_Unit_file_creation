Addon Unit file for RHEL linux.
Path /etc/systemd/system/<app>
If you have a bash script in any path and want to create custom made unit file.
let us consider the path of the script is /usr/local/bin/<app.sh>

Create the unit file.
vi /etc/systemd/system/app.service

In this file app.service mention below. Need to tweak according to the requirement.

[Unit]
Description=My Custom Application Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/app.sh
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
User=appuser
Group=appuser
Environment=ENV=production
WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/bin

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Save and exit the file.
IMP fields that requires in this file are:

ExecStart= → required
Type=simple → default, best for scripts
User= → don’t run as root unless needed
WantedBy=multi-user.target → normal system services

Reload systemd:
#systemctl daemon-reload
Enable at boot
#systemctl enable <app>
Start now
#systemctl start <app>
View logs
journalctl -u <app> -f
